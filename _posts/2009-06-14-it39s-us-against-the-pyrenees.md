Hola amigos!

So, the 2nd day has almost passed and we managed to survive till now&#8230; somehow!  
The very first climb was up the summit of a 2000m mountain (and will hopefully be the highest and worst point of our journey.

Due to the harsh mountains we only made some 35-40km so far and left Andorra this morning after camping on a nice slope in the mountains.

So far everything seem alright, some blisters here, some scratches there, but in the end we..re still alive ..n kickin ðŸ˜‰

Today we..re gonna take it a little slower since we got quite a few things to be done in the city of Val D..Urgell (and due to a Spanish oddity any shop closes between around noon and 4), so we wont make it that far.

Hope you guys back home and all over the world are alright!
