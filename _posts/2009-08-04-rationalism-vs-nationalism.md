Just a quick thought.

The subject might sound a little confusing to you since the two things dont necessarily have anything to do with each other. Anyway, let me explain to you.

From time to time, I&#8217;m coming across people that claim to be proud of their country. I am wondering why this is.  
I have nothing against pride per se. But I tend to be proud of my own achievements rather than that of others. You might call me overly rational and non-emotional, but I certainly can&#8217;t agree. I am an emotional person, but only when it comes to real persons, and certainly not when it comes to such huge anonymous subjects like a country.

Please don&#8217;t get me wrong, I am absolutely not trying to say that community is not important. Quite the opposite! But again, this community doesn&#8217;t necessarily have anything to do with the country we live it. It can consist of two people, a neighbourhood, a region, a football club, or whatever. Countries are just artificial subjects with strict borders that often don&#8217;t excist in reality.

Nationalism is just the forerunner of such unfavourable things like fascism. Never forget where you come from, don&#8217;t neglect your culture and your brothers, just drop the thought of being proud of your country.
